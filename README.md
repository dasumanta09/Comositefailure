# Comositefailure
A data-driven failure model for Fiber-reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites using a Deep Neural
Network (DNN) trained on experimental biaxial and triaxial stress data.
â€“ The DNN will be compared with conventional failure theories for accurately predicting the final failure of composite
laminates based on laminate layup, lamina properties, and loading conditions
